mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by ebx + ecx*4.  The bug arises if ecx is a very large value, causing an integer overflow.  If ecx*4 exceeds the maximum addressable memory, it will wrap around to a small value, causing the code to access an unintended memory location. This can lead to segmentation faults, unexpected data reads, or program crashes.  This is particularly problematic in 64-bit environments where the address space is larger but the overflow can still happen if the calculation is not carefully handled.
